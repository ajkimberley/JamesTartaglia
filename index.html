                        Welcome to my website. I'm a British philosopher working at the Slovak Academy of Sciences, who
                        tries to write original philosophy books that might
                        interest both the general public and professionals. I'm also a jazz musician who
                        makes Jazz-Philosophy Fusion. My main books are published by Bloomsbury:
                        <i>Philosophy in a Meaningless Life</i> (2016) and <i>Philosophy in a Technological
                            World: GODS AND TITANS</i> (2020). <a href="https://www.dfkcommunityhub.co.uk/"

                                between re-readings, will be in conversation with it, dancing in 'an inner space in which

                                words that both challenge and delight. He has correctly identified the corrosive impact of
                                the dominant materialist worldview, highlighted its deficiencies, and articulated a path for
                                the restoration of a metaphysics-based philosophy to its proper seat at the cultural table.
                                I commend him on his latest effort and recommend it to all who are curious about the state

                            <p>"There can be no question that our lives are dominated by technology, that we live in a
                                technological world. But few philosophers these days address the question of what this means
                                for us, and what philosophical world view it generates or presupposes. James Tartaglia's new
                                book is a highly original attempt to answer these questions. Tartaglia identifies
                                materialism as the doctrine which sustains the technology-based vision of life today, and he
                                challenges materialism in original and inventive ways — his challenges are not the usual
                                ones you find in today's philosophy textbooks. This book is ambitious and inventive — it is
                                not a standard work of academic philosophy, but (like his last book, <i>Philosophy in a
                                    Meaningless Life</i>) attempts to speak to all those with a philosophical interest,
                                whether
                                inside or outside universities. This is a very special book, highly recommended"</p>

                            <p>"A fascinating book. It is refreshing to read a well-written book of contemporary philosophy
                                that puts the question of the meaning of life at its very centre and at the very centre of
                                philosophy itself. The argument rests on a huge amount of reading and learning, lightly
                                worn. And, in particular, in highlighting the difference between meaning (significance) in
                                life and the meaning of life Tartaglia has done any philosopher who thinks about either of
                                these things a great favour. He makes a very persuasive case that recent discussions have
                                equivocated between these two different concepts. And he may well be right that this
                                equivocation has been motivated by a fear of nihilism."</p>

                            <p>"A superb and original work. Tartaglia addresses head-on the question of the meaning of life
                                - which he calls 'the keystone of philosophy' - and gives an uncompromising nihilist answer
                                to it. But rather than turning to gloom and despair, he shows how nihilism is, in a certain
                                sense, neither good nor bad; and that it can be used to address some central traditional
                                questions of philosophy: about consciousness, time and universals. Elegantly written and
                                very readable, this is a unique work of philosophy that deserves a wide readership."</p>
