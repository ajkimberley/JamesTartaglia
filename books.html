                <h4 class="text-light-grey text-uppercase">Gods and Titans</h4>
                <p>
                    Philosophy has come to seem like a specialist interest with little or no influence on our lives. On
                    the contrary, argues James Tartaglia, it was the philosophy of materialism which taught us to turn
                    from the gods to seek practical assistance from the titans, thereby reversing the moral of an
                    ancient Greek myth to inspire the building of today’s technological world. As the largely
                    unreflected belief-system it has now become, materialism continues to steer the direction of
                    technological development, while making us think this direction is inevitable. By drawing on
                    neglected idealist traditions of philosophy, Tartaglia argues for a new way of looking at reality
                    which asserts our freedom to choose, reaffirms and builds upon our ordinary, everyday understanding,
                    and motivates us to convert technological innovation into a process driven by public rationality and
                    consent. With discussions ranging from consciousness, determinism and personal identity, to
                    post-truth culture, ego-death and video games, this clear and accessible book will be of wide
                    interest.

                                    There can be no question that our lives are dominated by technology, that we live
                                    in a technological world. But few philosophers these days address the question of
                                    what this means for us, and what philosophical world view it generates or
                                    presupposes. This is a highly original attempt to answer these questions. Tartaglia
                                    identifies materialism as the doctrine which sustains the technology-based vision of
                                    life today, and he challenges materialism in original and inventive ways.

                <p>
                    This book provides an account of the nature of philosophy which is rooted in the question of the
                    meaning of life. It makes the case for believing that this question is neither obscure nor obsolete,
                    but reflects a quintessentially human concern to which other traditional philosophical problems can
                    be readily related, allowing them to be reconnected with natural interest, and providing a diagnosis
                    of the typical lines of opposition across philosophy’s debates. Tartaglia looks at the various ways
                    philosophers have tried to avoid the conclusion that life is meaningless, and in the process have
                    distanced philosophy from the concept of transcendence. Rejecting all of this, Tartaglia embraces
                    nihilism (‘we are here with nothing to do’), and uses transcendence both to provide a new solution
                    to the problem of consciousness, and to explain away perplexities about time and universals.

                <p>Nihilism has received a grossly misleading press, in our view. Far from being a problem
                    that needs to be overcome, we will argue that it is an insightful and morally anodyne
                    philosophical outlook on the world; one which allows us to take a cosmic perspective on
                    our lives without making religious presuppositions. As such, our objective in this short
                    book will be to rehabilitate nihilism’s public image. If we can achieve this, we think a
                    significant barrier of misunderstanding between religious believers and atheists will
                    have been removed.</p>
